#Hashing
  largest subarray with 0 sum
  count distinct elements in every window
  array pair sum divisibility
  longest consecutive subsequence  a[] = {2,6,1,9,4,5,3} o/p 123456
  zero sum subarrays


#Graph



#Greedy
  activity selection - sort the pair by finish time and loop over to find finish < start
  Page Faults in LRU - hashmap pageNo, Index
  largest number possible N = 2, S = 9, O = 90



#DynamicProgramming
  max length chain  -- similar to activity selection



#Backtracking
